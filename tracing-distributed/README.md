# eaze-tracing-distributed

Current version: 0.2.0-eaze.5

This crate provides:
- `TelemetryLayer`, a generic tracing layer that handles publishing spans and events to arbitrary backends
- Utilities for implementing distributed tracing for arbitrary backends

As a tracing layer, `TelemetryLayer` can be composed with other layers to provide stdout logging, filtering, etc.

This crate is primarily intended to be used by people implementing their own backends.
A concrete implementation using honeycomb.io as a backend is available in the [`tracing-honeycomb` crate](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-honeycomb).
